This repository contains the XML Schema of the Chemical Subgraphs & Reactions Mark-up Language (CSRML).
This is *not* the primary source of this schema, but just here for convenience and discussion.

The CSRML schema was developed by [Molecular Networks GmbH](http://www.molecular-networks.com/) and made available on https://chemotyper.org/:

    Both the XML Schema Definition of CSRML, and the source code of the
    CSRML reference implementation are released under the GNU Lesser
    General Public License Version 2.1 and can be downloaded free-of-charge.

The [XML Schema](https://github.com/egonw/csrml-schema/blob/master/csrml-2.0.xsd) has a richer copyright statement and the CSRML paper was published in 2015:
