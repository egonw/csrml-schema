This repository contains the XML Schema of the Chemical Subgraphs & Reactions Mark-up Language (CSRML).
This is *not* the primary source of this schema.

The CSRML schema was developed by Molecular Networks GmbH and made available on https://chemotyper.org/:

    Both the XML Schema Definition of CSRML, and the source code of the CSRML reference implementation
    are released under the ​GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1 and can be downloaded
    free-of-charge.

The XML Schema has a richer copyright statement and rhe CSRML paper was published in 2015:
